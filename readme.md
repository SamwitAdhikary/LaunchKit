# LaunchKit

**LaunchKit** is a modern, framework-agonistic Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) that makes deploying any application to the cloud as easy as running a single command. Whether you're building in Django, Node.js, Go, Rust, or a static site, LaunchKit handles everything - from project initialization through deployment, scaling, custom domains, SSL, monitoring, and team collaboration - so you can focus on writing code, not provisioning servers.

---

## üöÄ Why LaunchKit?

### 1. One CLI to Rule Them All

Automate every setp with the `launchkit` command:

```bash
launchkit init       # Scaffold your project
launchkit deploy     # Build, push, and release
launchkit env list   # Manage environments
launchkit domain add # Provision SSL and DNS
launchkit logs       # Stream real-time logs
launchkit rollback   # Instantly roll back release
```

### 2. Universal Framework Support
Out-of-the-box detection for Django, Rails, Node.js, React, Veu, Go, Rust, static sites, and more coming every sprint.

### 3. Rich Web Dashboard
Visualize your applications, inspect logs & metrics, manage domains, and collaborate with your team in beautiful React interface.

### 4. Self-Hosted, Open & Extensible
Full source code for CLI, API server, dashboard, and IaC (CDK/Terraform). Fork it, extend it, or integrate it into your enterprise toolchain.

### 5. Infrastructure as Code
AWS CDK (TypeScript) stacks and Terraform modules for VPC, RDS, ECS/Fargate, S3, CloudFront, and Route 53 - ready to customize.

### 6. Built-in CI/CD & Migrations
Alembic migrations for your database, real-time deployment logs, zero-downtime releases, and instant rollbacks.
